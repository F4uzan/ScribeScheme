## Scribes Colour Schemes
Additional colour schemes for the [Scribes Text Editor](http://scribes.sourceforge.net/index.html). These are all generated using the handy [Scribes Theme Generator](http://scribes.sourceforge.net/themegenerator.php).

To use, simply load them in the Theme Selector. These should immediately work after you've added them.

I hold no credit for (a lot) of colour schemes here; instead, I have credited the authors of the original colour scheme (if any) in the 'author' field of the theme.
